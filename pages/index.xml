&lt;p>Hi! I use software to solve big and important business problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is important, is not only &lt;em>what&lt;/em> you do, but &lt;em>how&lt;/em> you do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I choose my tools with care, based on the problem. Taking time to gain clarity as challenges come, and working out how best to proceed. The key to understanding, involves clear &amp;amp; effective communication, whether presented verbally, visually or written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most businesses suffer from major inefficiencies, wasting time and resources on processes, which do not benefit the business. I deeply care about removing these barriers, streamlining processes, and creating systems. Resulting in improvements in key areas such as performance, scalability, and security.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
