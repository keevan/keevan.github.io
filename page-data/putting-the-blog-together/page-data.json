And as much as I wanted to write something, I never got around to it. With that said, this first post will dive straight into the thick of it.</p>\n<h3>Thought Process</h3>\n<p>I want to write content that I believe would help future me, and also inspire and help others. And so, I will share my current work-in-progress journey, one purposed to involve little time in maintaining.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have topics I want to share.</li>\n<li>Pick a framework to lay out the content.</li>\n<li>In the future, ensure it empowers me to focus on the content and less on the internals.</li>\n<li>Allow for potential scaling, and build it out bit by bit.</li>\n<li>And last but probably the most important, I want to ensure a high level of readability later on, which means conciseness, structure and clear intent - unlike this first post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\n<p>For the reasons above, I chose to host the content and open source the code on GitHub ❤️, and use Gatsby as the framework that ties it all together. I plan to add GitHub actions to automatically deploy after pushing or merging changes.</p>\n<p>I’ve already added a couple of bells and whistles using Gatsby, mainly adding the reading time to all blog entries so the reader knows how long each article will take to read, and so I know if I need to simplify and shorten it. Also, premature support for MDX, which will see more usage down the line when I add more technical posts (+1 for interactivity).</p>\n<p>Whilst I could grab off-the-shelf software or services to do that which <em>has already been done before™️</em>, I want to learn all the bits that connect it all together - and other developers would probably agree.</p>\n<p>I wish I had started with the blog starter instead of the gatsby starter - which would have saved me a bit of time - but found it interesting to add the required bits manually anyways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Github as the place to host the code - at least initially.</li>\n<li>Gatsby as the framework that powers it - it has a powerful plugin system, has site performance in mind with regular updates.</li>\n<li>Atom as my daily editor - I use it for coding, so naturally I’ll use it for managing content.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure class=\"md-figure\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 43.66666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"atom\"\n        title=\"atom\"\n        src=\"/static/fab6b6627af218a8e0534e07a447698b/c1b63/atom.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fab6b6627af218a8e0534e07a447698b/5a46d/atom.png 300w,\n/static/fab6b6627af218a8e0534e07a447698b/0a47e/atom.png 600w,\n/static/fab6b6627af218a8e0534e07a447698b/c1b63/atom.png 1200w,\n/static/fab6b6627af218a8e0534e07a447698b/764d7/atom.png 1782w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span><figcaption>Atom, showing this entry in progress</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Workflow</h3>\n<p>My brain-dump for my ideal process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conception</strong> - Have a topic I want to share.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose Categorisation</strong> - Decide on whether it should categorise as a blog post going over my thoughts on the matter, a small guide of sorts showing how I solved a particular problem, or something else. Give what I write, <em>a goal</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply Formula</strong> - Write down all the notes / key points I have on that topic, e.g. recorded whilst working through the problem. And apply a standard formula so that when it comes time to format / edit the content, it reads more consistently and orderly.</li>\n<li><strong>Review / Revise</strong> - Read over the content and ensure correctness to the best of my abilities, and that it gets the point across.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I foresee a bumpy road with a lot of research and development, but I will document the journey bring to light the pain points experienced. I feel happy with what I’ve managed to string together thus far.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Have you travelled down this road before? How did you approach this problem? I guess by the time I’ve written this I haven’t added comment support yet, but perhaps later on I would have.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Putting the blog together","date":"March 12, 2022","description":"Diving head first into the world of blogging"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/putting-the-blog-together/","readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Putting the blog together"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/adding-the-bells-and-whistles-to-a-gatsby-blog/","readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Adding the Bells and Whistles to a Gatsby Blog"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ed9551b9-af6a-5e14-92fd-504d569f48fb","previousPostId":"a77598c8-ec4b-5ba1-97bd-9716e6352cd5","nextPostId":"c1b0140a-c7e9-5db2-8164-c6bdebced4ca"}},
