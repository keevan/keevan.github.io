And yes, you are correct.</p><h2 id=the-dilemma>The dilemma</h2><p>I encountered no major issues using GatsbyJS &ndash; an enjoyable framework to use. Finding myself gradually becoming more distracted by what it had to offer consumed more time than I wanted to spend. I became trapped and focused on looking at the <em>shiny</em>, instead of focusing more on what I wanted to do originally &ndash; start writing some content.</p><p>It also bugged me, that using Gatsby, regardless of its benefits, would take a considerable time to build (around 30s - 1m), and even more time to get started with development.</p><p>I feel the same about the majority of JS frameworks. I don&rsquo;t believe JS itself has slow performance, but the impression I get suggests this, though it more realistically comes down to the current state of the tooling.</p><h2 id=reflection>Reflection</h2><p>Drawing back to the first principles:</p><ul><li>I wanted to focus on adding / editing content.</li><li>It has to scale nicely.</li></ul><p>So far, Gatsby hasn&rsquo;t broken any of these rules. But due to client scope creep, I wanted more:</p><ul><li>Quick build / dev times.</li><li>Had to be minimal &ndash; enough to do what I need to, and to not distract me.</li></ul><p>Hugo kept lingering around as the tool that might fix all my problems. I gave it a try, and I was impressed.</p><ul><li>the time to spin up the dev server was less than a second</li><li>build speeds also less than a second</li><li>less JS meant more lightweight for the end-user</li></ul><p>Though it wasn&rsquo;t all sunshine and rainbows. The CLI tool&rsquo;s internal docs could be improved, as I had to go to the official docs to figure it out. Concepts like using themes and creating new content types were also a bit foreign &ndash; had to look that one up too. But once I understood the basics, navigating around seemed straightforward.</p><h2 id=the-breakup>The breakup</h2><p>As much as I love using Gatsby, the build times aren&rsquo;t quite there yet. Also, as I want to focus more on content and less about <em>features I could add</em>, having Javascript there was a big distraction.</p><p>Javascript has a way of drawing my focus moreso towards behaviour, than the content which is the important bit.</p><p>Also, disadvantages of adding more NPM dependencies are real, which affect areas like bundle size, security, and performance costs for the viewer.</p><p>Aside from trying the very shiny, like Astro and îles, I opted to go with Hugo, which would be more in line with what I need now. From this experience, I&rsquo;ve split out my <em>blog content</em> into another repository, which should make switching again in the future, much easier.</p><p>Whether this decision was right, I&rsquo;ll just have to find out.</p></div></div><div class=flex-grow></div><div class=footer><div>© 2022 Kevin Pham</div><div class=footer-social><span class="social-icon social-icon-twitter"><a href=https://twitter.com/KeevanPham title=Twitter target=_blank rel="noopener me"><img src=/images/social/twitter.svg width=24 height=24 alt=Twitter></a></span>
