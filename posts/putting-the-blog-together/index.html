And as much as I wanted to write something, I never got around to it. With that said, this first post will dive straight into the thick of it.</p><h3 id=thought-process>Thought Process</h3><p>I want to write content that I believe would help future me, and also inspire and help others. And so, I will share my current work-in-progress journey, one purposed to involve little time in maintaining.</p><ul><li>Have topics I want to share.</li><li>Pick a framework to lay out the content.</li><li>In the future, ensure it empowers me to focus on the content and less on the internals.</li><li>Allow for potential scaling, and build it out bit by bit.</li><li>And last but probably the most important, I want to ensure a high level of readability later on, which means conciseness, structure and clear intent - unlike this first post.</li></ul><h3 id=reflection>Reflection</h3><p>For the reasons above, I chose to host the content and open source the code on GitHub ❤️, and use Gatsby as the framework that ties it all together. I plan to add GitHub actions to automatically deploy after pushing or merging changes.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve already added a couple of bells and whistles using Gatsby, mainly adding the reading time to all blog entries so the reader knows how long each article will take to read, and so I know if I need to simplify and shorten it. Also, premature support for MDX, which will see more usage down the line when I add more technical posts (+1 for interactivity).</p><p>Whilst I could grab off-the-shelf software or services to do that which <em>has already been done before™️</em>, I want to learn all the bits that connect it all together - and other developers would probably agree.</p><p>I wish I had started with the blog starter instead of the gatsby starter - which would have saved me a bit of time - but found it interesting to add the required bits manually anyways.</p><ol><li>Github as the place to host the code - at least initially.</li><li>Gatsby as the framework that powers it - it has a powerful plugin system, has site performance in mind with regular updates.</li><li>Atom as my daily editor - I use it for coding, so naturally I&rsquo;ll use it for managing content.</li></ol><p><img src=atom.png alt="Atom, showing this entry in progress"></p><h3 id=workflow>Workflow</h3><p>My brain-dump for my ideal process:</p><ul><li><strong>Conception</strong> - Have a topic I want to share.</li><li><strong>Choose Categorisation</strong> - Decide on whether it should categorise as a blog post going over my thoughts on the matter, a small guide of sorts showing how I solved a particular problem, or something else. Give what I write, <em>a goal</em>.</li><li><strong>Apply Formula</strong> - Write down all the notes / key points I have on that topic, e.g. recorded whilst working through the problem. And apply a standard formula so that when it comes time to format / edit the content, it reads more consistently and orderly.</li><li><strong>Review / Revise</strong> - Read over the content and ensure correctness to the best of my abilities, and that it gets the point across.</li></ul><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>I foresee a bumpy road with a lot of research and development, but I will document the journey bring to light the pain points experienced. I feel happy with what I&rsquo;ve managed to string together thus far.</p><p>What do you think? Have you travelled down this road before? How did you approach this problem? I guess by the time I&rsquo;ve written this I haven&rsquo;t added comment support yet, but perhaps later on I would have.</p></div></div><div class=flex-grow></div><div class=footer><div>© 2022 Kevin Pham</div><div class=footer-social><span class="social-icon social-icon-twitter"><a href=https://twitter.com/KeevanPham title=Twitter target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/images/social/twitter.svg width=24 height=24 alt=Twitter></a></span>
