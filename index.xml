A history filled with combinations of unique upbringings, cultures, experiences, joys and sufferings.
How language fits into all of this Words matter. They are used to convey ideas, tell stories, describe objects, grow communities, teach others, etc.
Words can be used for good:
to uplift, to inspire, to comfort, to bring clarity. Or bad:
to put down, to provoke, to spread misinformation, to marginalise.</description></item><item><title>Blaming the user</title><link>/posts/blaming-the-user/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 17:52:32 +1100</pubDate><guid>/posts/blaming-the-user/</guid><description>The user is clearly at fault, not your software.

This topic seems to come up often. Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down.
Why you might feel this way If you work in the service industry, you might know the expression:
&amp;ldquo;The customer is always right.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s painful to hear, especially when it comes from the customer&amp;rsquo;s mouth, or your boss, or your colleague. So when might this happen?

And yes, you are correct.
The dilemma I encountered no major issues using GatsbyJS &amp;ndash; an enjoyable framework to use. Finding myself gradually becoming more distracted by what it had to offer consumed more time than I wanted to spend. I became trapped and focused on looking at the shiny, instead of focusing more on what I wanted to do originally &amp;ndash; start writing some content.</description></item><item><title>Putting the blog together</title><link>/posts/putting-the-blog-together/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 13:53:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/putting-the-blog-together/</guid><description>I enjoy reading.

Thought Process I want to write content that I believe would help future me, and also inspire and help others. And so, I will share my current work-in-progress journey, one purposed to involve little time in maintaining.

What is important, is not only what you do, but how you do it.
I choose my tools with care, based on the problem. Taking time to gain clarity as challenges come, and working out how best to proceed. The key to understanding, involves clear &amp;amp; effective communication, whether presented verbally, visually or written.
